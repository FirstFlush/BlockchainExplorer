# Blockchain Explorer

A simple C# tool for querying the blockchain of a Bitcoin node. This project serves as a learning exercise to help me explore C# and Entity Framework Core, with a focus on the repository pattern and best practices for application structure.

## Purpose

This application was built for the purpose of querying my BTCPayServer node. The project is not intended for production use and is primarily a way to learn and experiment with C#.

## Features

- Query transaction details from the blockchain.
- Query address information.
- Implemented using C# with .NET 8, Entity Framework Core, and the repository pattern.
- Includes basic API endpoints using ASP.NET Core.
